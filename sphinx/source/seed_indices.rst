SeedIndices
===========

The :py:class:`SeedIndices` module provides functionality for managing seed indices,
to convert seed phrases into indices and vice versa. Also provides methods to easily
generate string representations of seed indices, and read from string representations
back to a `SeedIndices` object and from there to a supported Seed.
